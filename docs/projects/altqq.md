# Alternative Queries

Alternative Queries is a library to help created type-checked and reusable
handcrafted SQL queries. The library also manages merging of parameters from
nested queries, making sure that the parameters are passed to your database
connection correctly.

The library is still in development and there's still no `0.1` release. If
you are curious however, feel free to check the [Alternative Queries Documentation]
and try it out by downloading the [Alternative Queries Package].
